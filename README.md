# Mission

Iron Key VentureDAO is a decentralized network of angel investors that operates as a fully decentralized venture fund. We hold an investment committee once a month to pitch and vote on and invest in web3 deals.


Values and Ethos:


1. Open Innovation: We believe that collaboration and coopetition is more effective than competition

2. We share deals: If members are not sharing deals - you will be removed ( the investment committee will set guidelines for this)

3. We help each other: By teaching something, you further your own understanding of complex topics
