# Mission
Values and Ethos of our decentralized network of angel investors



Open Innovation: We believe that collaboration and coopetition is more effective than competition

We share deals: If members are not sharing deals - you will be removed ( the investment committee will set guidelines for this)

We help each other: By teaching something, you further your own understanding of complex topics
