# Overview

This README tracks the evolution of Iron Key Capital; from starting as a web3 syndicate in 2021 and transforming into an investment DAO in 2025.


# Mission & Vision

We believe that VCs should be more than just capital allocators.

Iron Key Capital is a venture platform built by investors, for investors. In response to rapidly changing market conditions for early stage startup building and fundraising, we introduce new business models for founders and investors to make early stage capital deployment more efficient and user friendly.

Iron Key Venture Partners, i.e. the "investment club", is a service-focused Venture DAO that operates as a decentralized syndicate + investment club, a 12 week venture training program, an advisory division, and an innovation lab focused on venture infrastructure.


# Structure

Iron Key Capital is the brand name for the parent company Iron Key Ventures LLC, AKA "the mothership."

Iron Key Venture Partners LLC is a member-managed LLC based in Wyoming. Our Investment Club votes on startups 1x per month, deploys capital 4x per year, at a $25k - $100k check size into Seed Stage startups building at the intersection of web3 & AGI.

Iron Key Ventures LLC, a manager-managed LLC, owns 51%, subject to dilution, in the investment club.


# Values and Ethos:


1. Open Innovation: We believe that collaboration and coopetition is more effective than competition

2. We share deals: If members are not sharing deals - you will be removed ( the investment committee has set guidelines for this)

3. We help each other: By teaching something, you further your own understanding of complex topics

4. We build software: We automate as much as possible and eliminate trust wherever possible
